### Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

While coding this app, I particularly encountered challenges performing the Parcel functions, though I was quick to resolve such issues when I realized I copied the wrong dependency statements into my build gradle file. Also, I struggled a bit changing the appearance of the rating bar as I couldn't tell which attribute did what. Nonetheless, I really enioyed this assignment.
